## Welcome to r3mux
r3mux is a simple batch file that will scan an INPUT folder and remux all Matroska files to MPEG-4 files.

The reason I wrote it is because some of my personal devices have problems direct playing/streaming Matroska container type files from my Plex server and I wanted to simplify the process of remuxing my MKV's.



### What it does

The script will scan a specific folder for MKV files, will validate them using mkvalidator.exe
